              Should You Study BCA?
            </h1>

            <img
              src="/Img/bloga.webp"
              alt="Cultural Celebrations"
              class="img-fluid blogImage"
            />

            <p>
              As a BCA student myself, I can offer you my perspective based on
              my experience regarding whether you should pursue a BCA in 2024. I
              trust that after reading this article, you will be able to align
              your end goal and decide for yourself if BCA is the right choice
              for you. To provide some context about myself and my journey, I
              enrolled in BCA at MAKAUT University in 2021. My motivation
              stemmed from a desire to delve into the world of technology and
              perhaps create the next Facebook or Amazon. This aspiration was
              fueled by the notion that many billionaires were somehow linked to
              the tech industry. Looking back, this mindset heavily influenced
              my decision to pursue BCA. A strong piece of advice I'd like to
              share is that if you have a background in Pure Science and aspire
              to venture into computer science, opting for a BTech or a
              Bachelor's in Engineering might be the better choice. This
              recommendation stems from the fact that many prominent tech
              companies prioritize candidates with BTech degrees over those with
              BCA qualifications. Additionally, if research is on your radar,
              pursuing a BTech allows for a smoother transition into higher
              academic pursuits such as MTech and PhD, potentially bypassing the
              need for an MCA or MSc in CS/IT.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-primary-emphasis">Expectation vs. Reality:</h3>

            <p>
              My journey as a BCA student began in 2021 with lofty expectations.
              Like many prospective students, I expected a vibrant tech
              community teeming with innovation, alongside professors who were
              really passionate about coding. However, the reality I encountered
              was different. Hardly anyone spoke about building new tech,
              discussing future trends, or conducting case studies on successful
              tech companies. I do understand that computer science is more than
              coding, but the interest in this field, the zeal to teach, was
              missing.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-primary-emphasis">Course Curriculum:</h3>

            <p>
              I find the course curriculum to be well-designed. One of the
              cornerstones of any academic program is its curriculum, and BCA at
              MAKAUT University is no exception. The syllabus is meticulously
              designed to equip students with the fundamental knowledge required
              for a successful career in the tech industry. From core subjects
              like Object-Oriented Programming to optional advanced mathematics
              courses, the curriculum provides a solid foundation for students
              to build upon. However, it's important to emphasize that success
              in BCA requires more than just passive learning. It necessitates
              active engagement, self-study, and practical application to truly
              grasp the concepts and stay abreast of industry trends.
              <br />
              The curriculum covers almost all fundamental subjects found in
              most universities, including:

              <li>
                Programming Fundamentals (typically using languages like C, C++,
                Java, Python, etc.)
              </li>
              <li>Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
              <li>Operating Systems</li>
              <li>Computer Architecture and Organization</li>
              <li>Database Management Systems</li>
              <li>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts</li>
              <li>Software Engineering.</li>
              <li>Computer Networks</li>
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-primary-emphasis">Jobs After BCA:</h3>

            <p>
              This can be a controversial topic, so I'll share my firsthand
              experiences. If you're a BCA student, most on-campus placements
              tend to offer non-tech roles. I've rarely seen companies
              recruiting for tech positions after BCA, and this holds true even
              for some engineering colleges. Sometimes, companies offer salaries
              ranging from 12,000 to 20,000 this may vary college to college but
              upper limit is aroudn 35k per month on campus.
            </p>

            <p>
              I recently received an offer of 8 LPA base, which was significant
              for a BCA student. However, the role was that of an IT Consultant,
              which didn't align with my ambition to become a developer. In my
              opinion, this could be considered a career setback at the very
              beginning.
            </p>

            <p>
              Speaking from my firsthand off-campus experience, it's all about
              skill. Your degree might not be the deciding factor, but having a
              good college name on your resume will give that person an
              advantage because that is the X factor. You'll need to invest time
              in building X factors in your resume, networking, and gaining
              practical experience through internships and projects. Learning
              development, DSA, and other core fundamentals such as OOPs, DBMS,
              etc., are crucial, as competition extends beyond your batchmates
              to students from every college seeking opportunities.
            </p>

            <p>
              My advice is to remain vigilant and continue working hard. While
              opportunities will come your way, it's essential not to become
              complacent. Keep learning, adopt a problem-solving mindset, and
              strive to exceed expectations. Ultimately, whether on-campus or
              off-campus, success boils down to your skills.

              academic interests, and market realities. While BCA provides a
